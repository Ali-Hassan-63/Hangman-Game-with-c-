# Hangman-Game-with-c-
Development of a console based hangman game with c++.
In this game, the computer picks a random secret word from an available list. We will store a list of words using arrays while a random word will be chosen through the srand () function.  The concept of the game is that the player then guesses a letter that they think may appear in the word. After guessing, the computer checks whether the letter appears in the word and either reveals all instances of it (if it exists) or takes away one of the player's lives. The computer then displays the progress that the player has made towards guessing the word. The game continues until either all of the letters have been guessed (and the player wins) or all of the player's lives are used up (and the player loses). In either case, the computer should announce the conclusion and the game should end.
